        <h3>Preparation & Cooking</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the dough, tip the flour and a pinch of salt into a bowl. Add the oil to the flour and combine well with your hands.
                    <br>Slowly add 100ml water and knead the dough until it is stretchy. Cover with cling film and leave the dough to rest.</li>
                <li style>Tip all the filling ingredients into a bowl and season with salt. Use your hands to combine thoroughly.</li> 
                <li style>Divide the dough into 20 balls (each should weigh about 15g). Dust your work surface with flour and roll the balls into thin circles using a rolling pin.</li> 
                <li style>Spoon about 1 tsp filling in the centre of one circle, then use your thumb and forefinger to pinch together an edge of the dough into a fold.</li> 
                <li style>Continue to pinch along the edge of the circle and work your way all the way round.</li> 
                <li style>Bring all the pinched edges of the circle together to cover the filling and twist the top to seal it. Repeat with the rest of the dough and filling.</li> 
                <li style>Fill a bamboo steamer with water, layer the base with baking parchment and pierce some holes in it.</li> 
                <li style>Working in two to three batches, place the momos on the baking parchment and steam for 10 mins. They should look transparent <br> 
                    and not feel sticky when fully cooked. Keep warm while you steam the rest.</li> 
                <li style>While the momos are steaming, mix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl with 2 tbsp water. Serve the hot momos with the sauce for dipping.</li> 
            </ol>

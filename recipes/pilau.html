                <li>If you have time, tip the rice into a large bowl and soak in cold water for 30 mins. Rinse in cold running water, <br> 
                    then drain well, rinse and drain again. Repeat until the water is only slightly cloudy, then leave the rice in <br> 
                    a sieve set over the sink to drain completely.</li>
                <li style="margin-top: 10px;">Heat the butter or oil in a lidded pan over a medium heat and gently fry the onion with a large pinch of salt, <br> 
                    stirring occasionally for 10 mins until soft and golden. Stir in the whole spices and the bay and cook for 2 mins more.<br>
                    Add the ground coriander and turmeric, and cook for 1 min more. Gently stir in the drained rice to coat it in the onion <br>
